## About Me <a name="about-me"></a>

Hello, my name is Johnny and I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Accounting and Finance from University of New Hampshire. I discovered my interest in programming and have been learning various programming languages ever since. While I don't have any professional experience yet, I'm excited to start my career in the field and have been working hard to improve my skills and knowledge. I am eager to learn and apply my skills to real-world scenarios.

I'm passionate about accounting and enjoy learning about financial statements, taxation, and auditing. I'm also interested in learning how technology can be used to improve accounting processes and am currently learning programming languages such as Python and SQL to apply these skills in my future career.

In my studies, I gained a solid understanding of financial accounting, managerial accounting, financial management, and other core topics in the field. As a newcomer to the tech industry, I'm excited to apply my analytical and problem-solving skills to the world of programming. I'm currently learning the fundamentals of programming, including data structures, algorithms, and web development. I'm also working on personal projects to gain hands-on experience and improve my skills.

My background in accounting and finance has provided me with a strong foundation in mathematics, logic, and attention to detail. I believe these skills will translate well to programming and allow me to approach problems with a unique perspective.

In addition to my academic studies, I've been participating in online courses and workshops to gain additional knowledge and skills. I've also been volunteering with non-profit organizations to gain practical experience and make a positive impact in my community.

In my free time, I enjoy taking online courses and working on personal projects to build my skills. I am currently working on developing my data analysis and visualization skills through projects related to financial data. I am also interested in exploring the intersection of finance and technology, including emerging trends such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

My goal is to become a proficient programmer and use my skills to create innovative solutions that make a positive impact on the world. I'm a quick learner and a dedicated team player, and I'm looking forward to starting my career in accounting.
